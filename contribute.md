# How to Contribute 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

We are an open community of developers and learners around the world building resources for a better Web. Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.

Every part of Codepedia (docs, glossary, and the translations) are created by an open community of developers. Please, join us!

## Four Simple Steps to Codepedia

Codepedia is an online resource where anyone can add and edit its content. You don't need to be an expert programmer or know a lot about technologies. There are plenty of things that need to be done, from the simple (proofreading, correcting typos, translations) to the complex (writing API documentation).

Contributing is easy and safe. Even if you make a mistake, it's easily fixable. Even if you don't know exactly how things should look, or your grammar isn't all that good, don't worry about it! We have a team of people whose job it is to make sure that Codepedia's contents are as good as possible. 

Someone will be along to make sure your work is tidy and well-written. Share what you know and follow your strengths.

### Step 1: Create an account on GitHub

To begin your contributions to Codepedia, you need to have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and know how it works.

### Step 2: Pick an "Issue" to complete

- If you are a Codecademy learner: Now that you are logged in, read the descriptions of the different task types available on the main GitHub repo, and decide which one most appeals to you. You can pick any task you like and begin your contribution.
- If you are a Codecademy content contributor: Find your name within the Codepedia Entry Assignment Sheet.

### Step 3: Do the task

Once you've decided what kind of task you want to do, find a specific page, code example, etc. to work on, and just do it!

> If you're adding a new entry, there's a special script that will get everything set up for you. 
> Run `yarn new-entry` at your command line to go through a series of prompts about the entry 
> you're adding.

### Step 4: Ask for help

If you are not sure what to do at any point, then you are more than welcome to ask for help. There are a few different help options:

You can also shoot us a tweet [@Codecademy](https://twitter.com/Codecademy) or drop us an email at sonny@codecademy.com.

If you are learning programming and are stuck on a coding problem, we have [active forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com) where you can ask questions and get help.

Don't worry about doing it perfectly; other Codepedia contributors are here to help fix errors that slip through. If you want to experiment before doing something "for real", you can edit the Sandbox (TBA).
