## Adding a new concept

1. Create a folder for the concept in `codepedia` (i.e. loops).
2. Update `map.json` to include the phrase that should lead to that concept. (i.e. `"Loops": ["loops"]`)
3. Create a file in said folder with the format `[folder_name].md`. (i.e. loops/loops.md)
4. For language specific files, name them as `[folder_name].[language_file_suffix].md` (i.e. loops/loops.py.md)

## Running locally

1. `cd` to the `gh-page` folder
1. Run `yarn && yarn start`
1. Navigate to `localhost:5050` to see the local version of Codepedia

## Commiting development changes

1. Run `yarn build` in the `gh-page` folder to generate the compiled files
1. Commit all files that changed, including the `dist` folder
