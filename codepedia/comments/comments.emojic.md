# Emojicode Comments

## Single-line Comments

In Emojicode, single-line comments are made with `💭`. Any text after the `💭` that is on the same line is not executed.

```
💭 The next line outputs "Hello"
😀 🔤Hello🔤❗️
```
 
## Multiline Comments

Multiline comments are created with `💭🔜` and `🔚💭`. Any text in between is not executed.

```
💭🔜
This is a comment.
It will be ignored by the compiler.
🔚💭
```
