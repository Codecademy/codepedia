# JavaScript Comments

In JavaScript, single-line comments are created with two consecutive forward slashes `//`.

```js
// This line will denote a comment
```

Multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.

```js
/*  
The below configuration must be 
changed before deployment. 
*/
 
let baseUrl = 'localhost/taxwebapp/country';
```
