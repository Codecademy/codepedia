# Comments in JavaScript

A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

## Single-line Comments

In JavaScript, single-line comments are created with two consecutive forward slashes `//`.

```js
// This line will denote a comment
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.

```js
/*  
The below configuration must be 
changed before deployment. 
*/
 
let baseUrl = 'localhost/taxwebapp/country';
```
