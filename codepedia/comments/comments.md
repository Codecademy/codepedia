# Comments

Our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it—sometimes only a few hours later! For this reason, it’s often useful to leave a note or reminder in our code for our future selves or other developers.

A _comment_ is an explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. 

The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.
