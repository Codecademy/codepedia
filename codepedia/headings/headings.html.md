# HTML Heading Elements

HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level `<h1>` to the lowest level `<h6>`.

```hmtl
<h1>Breaking News</h1>
<h2>This is the 1st subheading</h2>
<h3>This is the 2nd subheading</h3>
<h4>This is the 3rd subheading</h4>
<h5>This is the 4th subheading</h5>
<h6>This is the 5th subheading</h6>
```

## Search Engines

Search engines like Google use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

**Note:** Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
