# Python Variables

A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character `_`.

The equal sign `=` is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed.

```py
# These are all valid variable names and assignment
 
user_name = "@sonnynomnom"
user_id = 100
verified = False
 
# A variable's value can be changed after assignment
 
points = 100
points = 120
```
