# Operators in Emojicode

## Arithmetic Operations

Computers are incredible at doing calculations. Now that we have declared variables, let’s use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things!

Emojicode supports arithmetic operators for:

* `➕`: addition
* `➖`: subtraction
* `✖️`: multiplication
* `➗`: division
* `🚮`: modulo (divides and gives the remainder)

For example:

```
4 ➕ 2 ➡️ score1     💭 scores1 is 6
 
4 ➖ 2 ➡️ score2     💭 scores2 is 2
 
4 ✖️ 2 ➡️ score3     💭 scores3 is 8
 
4 ➗ 2 ➡️ score4     💭 scores4 is 2
 
4 🚮 2 ➡️ score5     💭 scores5 is 0
```
