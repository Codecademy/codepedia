# Operators in C++

## Arithmetic Operators

C++ supports different types of arithmetic operators that can perform common mathematical operations:

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `%` modulo (yields the remainder)

```cpp
int x = 0;
 
x = 4 + 2;  // x is now 6
x = 4 - 2;  // x is now 2
x = 4 * 2;  // x is now 8
x = 4 / 2;  // x is now 2
x = 4 % 2;  // x is now 0
```
