# What is a Function?

A _function_ is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. 

You may have already seen various functions like `print()` and `main()`. These are called built-in functions provided by the language itself, but we can write our own functions as well.

Good thing about functions is that they are famous with several names. 

Different programming languages name them differently, for example, functions, methods, sub-routines, procedures, etc. If you come across any such terminology, then just imagine about the same concept.
