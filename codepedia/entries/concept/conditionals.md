# Condtionals Explained

In computer science, _conditional statements_ are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

In imperative programming language (i.e. Pascal and C), the term "conditional statement" is usually used, whereas in functional programming (i.e. Clojure and SQL), the terms "conditional expression" or "conditional construct" are preferred, because these terms all have distinct meanings.

Although dynamic dispatch is not usually classified as a conditional construct, it is another way to select between alternatives at runtime.
