# Ruby Arrays

In Ruby, an _array_ is an ordered collection of Ruby objects separated by commas and enclosed in `[]`. An _array_ can contain the same or different types of Ruby objects, such as Integers, Strings, Floats, etc. An _array_ can also be empty.

```rb
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#An array of Integers

words = ["See", "Spot", "run"]
#An array of Strings

mixed = ["hello", 5, true, 3.0]
#An array with a String, Integer, Boolean, and Float

empty = []
#An empty array
```
