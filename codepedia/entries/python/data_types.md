# Data Types in Python

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- Text Type: `str`
- Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- Boolean Type: `bool`
- Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping Type: `dict`
- Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
- Binary Types: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
