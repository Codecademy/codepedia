# Python Standard Library

The Python standard library, or stdlib for short, provides many useful modules in Python. It is included as part of the standard version of Python, so it requires no further installation.

The Python standard library contains built-in modules providing useful functions and definitions including access to system functionality such as file I/O (input/output), dates and times, math functions and constants, random number generation, and many more modules providing standardized solutions for common problems in programming.

The Python documentation provides an extensive [reference](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/index.html) for the Standard Library.
