# Data Types in Rust

Every variable, item, and value in a Rust program has a type. The type of a value defines the interpretation of the memory holding it and the operations that may be performed on the value.

Built-in types are tightly integrated into the language, in nontrivial ways that are not possible to emulate in user-defined types. User-defined types have limited capabilities.

The list of types is:

Primitive types:
- Boolean — `true` or `false`
- Numeric — integer and float
- Textual — `char` and `str`
- Never — `!` — a type with no values

Sequence types:
- Tuple
- Array
- Slice
- User-defined types:
- Struct
- Enum
- Union

Function types:
- Functions
- Closures

Pointer types:
- References
- Raw pointers
- Function pointers

Trait types:
- Trait objects
- Impl trait
