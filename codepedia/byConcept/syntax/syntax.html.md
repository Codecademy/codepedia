# Syntax in HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to structure that content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the HTML page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>It's div's child and body's grandchild</h1>
      <h2>It's h1's sibling</h2>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.
