# Arrays Explained

Arrays are lists of ordered, stored data. They can hold items that are of any data type. Arrays are created by using square brackets, with individual elements separated by commas.

```pseudo
array = [element0, element1, element2, element3]
```

## Index Number

You access an array element by referring to the index number.

A lot of times, array indexes start with 0:

- 0 is the first element. 
- 1 is the second element.
- 2 is the third element
- ...and so on.
