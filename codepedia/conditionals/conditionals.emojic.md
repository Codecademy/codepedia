# Conditionals in Emojicode

## If Statement

The `↪` statement is very important. It allows for conditional execution of a code block. The whole syntax is:

If the condition evaluates to `👍`, the code block will be executed, and if it evaluates to `👎`, it'll be ignored.

This example will display “a is greater than b” if the content for variable a* is greater than *b:

```bash
↪️ a ▶️ b 🍇
  😀 🔤a is greater than b🔤❗️
🍉
```

# Else Statement

The `🙅` extends an `↪️` statement to execute an additional code block in case the expression in the `if` statement evaluates to false. For example, the following code would display “a is greater than b” if a is greater than b, and “a is not greater than b” otherwise:

```bash
↪️ a ▶️ b 🍇
  😀 🔤a is greater than b🔤❗️
🍉
🙅 🍇
  😀 🔤a is not greater than b🔤❗️
🍉
```

**Note:** The `🙅` statements is only executed if the `↪️` statement evaluated to `👎`, and if all `🙅↪️` statements evaluated to `👎` too.
