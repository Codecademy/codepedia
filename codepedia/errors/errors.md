# What is an Error?

We refer to the mistakes within the program as _errors_. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter we call those errors _bugs_. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces unexpected errors _debugging_.

On your programming journey, you are destined to encounter innumerable red errors. Some even say that 75% of development time is spent on debugging. But what makes a programmer successful isn’t avoiding errors, it’s knowing how to find the solution to the errors. And a good place to start is understanding what errors are.

# History

> “First actual case of bug being found.”

The story goes that on September 9th, 1947, computer scientist [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) found a moth in the Harvard Mark II computer’s logbook and reported the world’s first literal computer bug. However, the term “bug,” in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1878 and with Thomas Edison.

# Syntax Errors

Every language has rules regarding the structure of words and phrases in a sentence. The rules that define this structure are known as syntax. If you texted your friend "The at will meet. pub I you in 10", your friend would be confused, and you would need to re-type the text.

Similarly to the English language, programming languages expect keywords, symbols, and values to be arranged in a certain, logical order according to syntax, otherwise the compiler will throw a syntax error.

# Logical Errors

Nearly every piece of code you write is an expression of some meaningful logic. This logic is the core of what you are intending to accomplish with your code. Sometimes you might write code in such a way that is syntactically correct but isn’t what you intended to express. This can be seen in any language, including English.
