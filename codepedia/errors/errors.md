# What is an Error?

We refer to the mistakes within the program as _errors_. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter we call those errors _bugs_. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces unexpected errors _debugging_.

On your programming journey, you are destined to encounter innumerable red errors. Some even say that 75% of development time is spent on debugging. But what makes a programmer successful isn’t avoiding errors, it’s knowing how to find the solution to the errors. And a good place to start is understanding what errors are.

# History

> “First actual case of bug being found.”

The story goes that on September 9th, 1947, computer scientist [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) found a moth in the Harvard Mark II computer’s logbook and reported the world’s first literal computer bug. However, the term “bug,” in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1878 and with Thomas Edison.

Python refers to the mistakes within the program as errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter we call those errors bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces unexpected errors debugging.
