# Objects Explained

In computer science, an _object_ can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

In the object-oriented programming paradigm,object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class-based flavour of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.

In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like `weight` and `color`:

- `car.name = "Tesla"`
- `car.model = 3`
- `car.weight = 1611`
- `car.color = "white"`

It will also methods like `start()` and `stop()`:

- `car.start()`
- `car.drive()`
- `car.brake()`
- `car.stop()`
